Theft Prediction in Chicago.

Theft is one of the most common crimes in our real world life. Theft often brings property lost and damage. Although most thefts do not harm oneâ€™s life, thefts do cause a lot of trouble to individuals as well as the city manager. In this project, the city of Chicago is selected as study area, I will analyze the current theft data of Chicago, and try to predict thefts with a set of variables with the method of Poisson regression. All data used in this project come from Chicago Open Data site (https://data.cityofchicago.org/).
